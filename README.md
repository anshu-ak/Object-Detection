# YOLO Object-Detection

### Introduction
```
YOLO stands for “You Only Look Once”. It applies a single forward pass
neural network to the whole image and predicts the bounding boxes and their
class probabilities as well. This techniques makes YOLO a super-fast real-time
object detection algorithm.
```

### Technology Stacks

- Python
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Darknet model, Open source deep neural network
- PyTorch
- COCO Dataset

### Implementation
```
In the image below I’ve used the YOLO algorithm to locate and classify
different objects, there’s a bounding box that locates each object and a
corresponding class label.
